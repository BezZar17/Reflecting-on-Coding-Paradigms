# Functional Prompt
# Implement a function that will flatten and sort an array of integers in ascending order, and      which adheres to a functional programming paradigm.
# My attempt
def num_lst(a,b,c):
  a = 32
  b = 12
  c = 86
  def flattern_and_sort(num_lst):
    # Had no clue what to put here
print(num_lst)

# Solution
# def flatten_and_sort(array):
#     arr = []
#     for item in array:
#         for i in item:
#             arr.append(i)
#     return sorted(arr)
